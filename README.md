# Project Title: Zillow Web Scraper & Form Auto-Filler
This project scrapes real estate listing data—such as property addresses, prices, and links—from the Zillow Clone website using BeautifulSoup, and then automatically inputs that data into a Google Form using Selenium. 
The scraping logic is encapsulated in the CollectData class, while the form submission is handled by the SaveData class. It combines web scraping and browser automation to streamline the process of data collection and reporting.
